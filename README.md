<br>Exercises were done after each section from a tutorial 

<br>A grand plan:
<br>I am going to add all materials and Bash commands and scripts that I have just learnt
<br>I will use Bash commands or write my own Bash Scripts like CreateFolder.sh to copy, modify and create files/folder and everything that I learnt from tutorial in this repo to practise using commands!!
<br>Adding description and usage of all Bash Commands for each exercise!
<br>In addition, I will add Bash commands that are usually use in a data field
<br>I will do also GitHub Action CI/CD workflow related to Bash Scripts
<br>I will create my own project based on these skills to practise it related to general usage and Data Engineering
<br>Doing a Bash Script to for loop for each folders finding files with .sh and copy from this one folder with files to another folder.
<br>For example, files sh with folder 1 should be in folder 2
